Release Notes for QUDA v0.5.0                        3 December 2012
-----------------------------

Overview:

QUDA is a library for performing calculations in lattice QCD on
graphics processing units (GPUs) using NVIDIA's "C for CUDA" API.
This release includes optimized kernels for applying a variety of
Dirac operators (Wilson, clover-improved Wilson, twisted mass,
improved staggered, and domain wall), kernels for performing various
BLAS-like operations, and full inverters built on these kernels.
Mixed-precision implementations of both CG and BiCGstab are provided,
with support for double, single, and half (16-bit fixed-point)
precision.  The staggered implementation additionally includes support
for HISQ link fattening, force terms for the HISQ fermion action
and one-loop improved Symanzik gauge action, and a multi-shift CG
solver.  Use of multiple GPUs in parallel is supported for all actions.


Software Compatibility:

The library has been tested under Linux (CentOS 5.8 and Ubuntu 12.04)
using release 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.0 of the CUDA toolkit.  CUDA 3.x
and earlier are not supported.  The library also works under Mac OS X
10.6.8 ("Snow Leopard") and 10.7.3 ("Lion") on recent 64-bit
Intel-based Macs.

See also "Known Issues" below.


Hardware Compatibility:

For a list of supported devices, see

http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

Before building the library, you should determine the "compute
capability" of your card, either from NVIDIA's documentation or by
running the deviceQuery example in the CUDA SDK, and pass the
appropriate value to QUDA's configure script.  For example, the Tesla
C1060 is listed on the above website as having compute capability 1.3,
and so to configure the library for this card, you'd run "configure
--enable-gpu-arch=sm_13 [other options]" before typing "make".

As of QUDA 0.4.0, only devices of compute capability 1.1 or greater
are supported.


Installation:

Installing the library involves running "configure" followed by
"make".  See "./configure --help" for a list of configure options.
At a minimum, you'll probably want to set the GPU architecture; see
"Hardware Compatibility" above.

Enabling multi-GPU support requires passing the --enable-multi-gpu
flag to configure, as well as --with-mpi=<PATH> and optionally
--with-qmp=<PATH>.  If the latter is given, QUDA will use QMP for
communications; otherwise, MPI will be called directly.  By default,
it is assumed that the MPI compiler wrappers are <MPI_PATH>/bin/mpicc
and <MPI_PATH>/bin/mpicxx for C and C++, respectively.  These choices
may be overriden by setting the CC and CXX variables on the command
line as follows:

./configure --enable-multi-gpu --with-mpi=<MPI_PATH> \
[--with-qmp=<QMP_PATH>] [OTHER_OPTIONS] CC=my_mpicc CXX=my_mpicxx

Finally, with some MPI implementations, executables compiled against
MPI will not run without "mpirun".  This has the side effect of
causing the configure script to believe that the compiler is failing
to produce a valid executable.  To skip these checks, one can trick
configure into thinking that it's cross-compiling by setting the
--build=none and --host=<HOST> flags.  For the latter,
"--host=x86_64-linux-gnu" should work on a 64-bit linux system.

If Fortran interface support is desired, the F90 environment variable
should be set when configure is invoked, and "make fortran" must be
run explicitly, since the Fortran interface modules are not built by
default.

As examples, the scripts "configure.milc.titan" and
"configure.chroma.titan" are provided.  These configure QUDA for
expected use with MILC and Chroma, respectively, on Titan (the Tesla
K20X-powered Cray XK7 supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility).

Throughout the library, auto-tuning is used to select optimal launch
parameters for most performance-critical kernels.  This tuning
process takes some time and will generally slow things down the first
time a given kernel is called during a run.  To avoid this one-time
overhead in subsequent runs (using the same action, solver, lattice
volume, etc.), the optimal parameters are cached to disk.  For this
to work, the QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH environment variable must be set,
pointing to a writeable directory.  Note that since the tuned parameters
are hardware-specific, this "resource directory" should not be shared
between jobs running on different systems (e.g., two clusters
with different GPUs installed).  Attempting to use parameters tuned
for one card on a different card may lead to unexpected errors.


Using the Library:

Include the header file include/quda.h in your application, link
against lib/libquda.a, and study tests/invert_test.cpp (for Wilson,
clover, twisted-mass, or domain wall fermions) or
tests/staggered_invert_test.cpp (for asqtad/HISQ fermions) for
examples of the solver interface.  The various solver options are
enumerated in include/enum_quda.h.


Known Issues:

* To perform staggered calculations on Kepler GPUs, it is necessary 
  to use texture objects to implement texture reads in the BLAS kernels. 
  Otherwise, for unclear reasons, the staggered multi-shift solver 
  can give junk results (NaNs). Texture objects are enabled by passing 
  the --enable-tex-object flag to configure.

* When used with drivers predating the CUDA 5.0 production release,
  Fermi-based GeForce cards suffer from occasional hangs when reading
  from double-precision textures, recoverable only with a soft reset.
  The recommended solution is to upgrade to the latest driver.
  Alternatively, such texture reads can be disabled (at the
  expense of some performance) by passing the
  --disable-fermi-double-tex flag to configure.

* For compatibility with CUDA, on 32-bit platforms the library is
  compiled with the GCC option -malign-double.  This differs from the
  GCC default and may affect the alignment of various structures,
  notably those of type QudaGaugeParam and QudaInvertParam, defined in
  quda.h.  Therefore, any code to be linked against QUDA should also
  be compiled with this option.

* The auto-tuner reports "0 Gflop/s" and "0 GB/s" for several of the
  Dslash kernels (visible if the verbosity is set to at least
  QUDA_SUMMARIZE), rather than the correct values.  This does not
  affect the tuning process or actual performance.

* At present, using MPI directly for communications (as opposed to
  QMP) requires calling some initialization routines that are not
  exposed in quda.h.  This will be corrected in the next release.

* Attempts to compile with GCC 4.7.x will fail due to bugs in the
  compiler.
